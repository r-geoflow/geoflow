Title: Orchestrate Geospatial (Meta)Data Management Workflows and Manage FAIR Services
Description: An engine to facilitate the orchestration and execution of metadata-driven data management workflows, in compliance with FAIR 
  (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data management principles. By means of a pivot metadata model, relying on the DublinCore standard (<https://dublincore.org/>), 
  a unique source of metadata can be used to operate multiple and inter-connected data management actions. Users can also customise their own workflows by creating specific actions 
  but the library comes with a set of native actions targeting common geographic information and data management, in particular actions oriented to the publication on the web of metadata 
  and data resources to provide standard discovery and access services. At first, default actions of the library were meant to focus on providing turn-key actions for geospatial (meta)data: 
  1) by creating manage geospatial (meta)data complying with ISO/TC211 (<https://committee.iso.org/home/tc211>) and OGC (<https://www.ogc.org/standards>) geographic information standards 
  (eg 19115/19119/19110/19139) and related best practices (eg. INSPIRE); and 2) by facilitating extraction, reading and publishing of standard geospatial (meta)data within widely used software 
  that compound a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), including spatial databases (eg. 'PostGIS'), metadata catalogues (eg. 'GeoNetwork', 'CSW' servers), data servers (eg. 'GeoServer'). The library was 
  then extended to actions for other domains: 1) biodiversity (meta)data standard management including handling of 'EML' metadata, and their management with 'DataOne' servers, 2) in situ sensors, 
  remote sensing and model outputs  (meta)data standard management by handling part of CF conventions, 'NetCDF' data format and OPeNDAP access protocol, and their management with Thredds servers, 
  3) generic / domain agnostic (meta)data standard managers ('DublinCore', 'DataCite'), to facilitate the publication of data within (meta)data repositories such as 'Zenodo' (<https://zenodo.org>) 
  or DataVerse (<https://dataverse.org/>). The execution of several actions will then allow to cross-reference (meta)data resources in each action performed, offering a way to bind resources 
  between each other (eg. reference 'Zenodo' DOIs in 'GeoNetwork'/'GeoServer' metadata, or vice versa reference 'GeoNetwork'/'GeoServer' links in 'Zenodo' or 'EML' metadata). The use of
  standardized configuration files ('JSON' format) allows fully reproducible workflows to facilitate the work of data and information managers.
